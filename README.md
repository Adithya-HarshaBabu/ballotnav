# BallotNav

BallotNav is a project of Hack for LA. Hack for LA is a brigade of a Code for America that exists to connect citizens with civic rights and responsibilities. BallotNav helps those who are concerned about using USPS for their mail-in ballots find their local drop-off points and their available days/times. The app's main features include locating the drop-off points closest to the user, and displaying what dates and times they are available; pulling in this information as it becomes available from county election supervisors; and connecting with users' social accounts to encourage dissemination of the tool and information.

### Project context

Voters in the upcoming presidential election are caught between a rock and a hard place: voting at the polls carries the possibility of covid-19 infection, while at the same time, the USPS is in crisis and our Constitutionally-protcted right to reliable mail is insecure. Mail-in ballots may be securely dropped-off in person; however, the locations do not neccesarily correspond to polling places, drop-offs may need to be made on specific dates and times under varying conditions to be valid, and this information can be hard to locate. Additionally, in many cases when this information will become available is not known. A centralized, specific tool for locating this information may assist in maintaining the franchise for some individuals who might either give up in frustration, or run the risk of their vote being uncounted due to mail failures.
